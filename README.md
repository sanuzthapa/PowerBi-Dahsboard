# PowerBI project for Uniqlo expansion plan (France) Context

##Description About the project :
Uniqlo is a Japanese brand for ready to wear, it was created in 1980. It has become in a few 
years a contender in the global fast fashion retail market. Despite having to compete against 
other bigger players like ZARA (Inditex), H&M, Uniqlo has still managed to grow and enforce 
its physical and digital presence in the global market. Uniqlo owned 2400 stores worldwide, 
this is due to a strong expansion strategy conducted by the company since its creation. 
In 2007 the brand opened its first store in France, as of today we count 270 stores nationally. 
However, the executives estimated that this presence doesn’t cover all France’s regions, thus 
they need to open at least 3 more stores in the upcoming 2 years by region each year in the 
aim to strengthen their presence and, as a result their market part.
